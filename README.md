# Alcohol-Detection-And-Motor-Locking
This project enhances road safety by integrating an alcohol detection system with a motor locking mechanism in vehicles. Using advanced sensors, GSM, and GPS technology, the system detects a driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and prevents the vehicle from starting if the BAC exceeds legal limits.
